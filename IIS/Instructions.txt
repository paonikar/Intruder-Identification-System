Follow these steps to run the Intruder Identification program:

1. Open Pic.java.

2. Go to line 30 and replace the username and folder locations as per requirements. Change:

a) username

b) cloud_account ---> your cloud folder

c) subfolder ---> subfolder within cloud folder

d) filename ---> rename as you wish

3. Save & exit.

4. Open main.cpp in notepad.

5. Go to line 61.

6. Rename username and cloud_folder just like in the previous steps.

7. Save & exit.

8. Put all software-set files in a secured location. We will use the location "C:\Windows\System32\example\" as an example.

9. Open "1 Enable.bat" in notepad.

10. Go to line 3.

11. And change the username and folder_location "C:\Windows\System32\example\Intruder Identification System\Software-set".

12. Save & Exit.

13. Create a shortcut of "runit.vbs".

14. Copy that shortcut to Windows Startup. 

15. Now, everything is set and the Intruder Identification System is put to work, the next time the computer is started.

16. To disable the Intruder Identification System, copy "0 Disable.bat" to any location. We recommend you to put it in an external USB flash drive, to make it work as a key. When Intruder Identification System needs to be stopped, just double-click to run "0 Disable.bat".
